# 🛠️ Project Overview:Deep Learning - Image Classification with CNN

### ❓ **WHAT IS IT ABOUT:**

   * Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images into predefined categories.
   * Dataset: CIFAR-10: 60,000 color images (10 classes, 32x32 size) [Download](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

### 🧐 **WHAT TO DO:**

* #### 🥝 Data Preprocessing:

   * Load and preprocess images (e.g., normalize, resize, augment).
   * Visualize some sample images and their labels.

* #### 🚀 Model Architecture:

   * Design a CNN with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.

* #### 🎓 Model Training:

   * Train using optimization methods like SGD or Adam.
   * Implement early stopping to reduce overfitting.

* #### 🍊 Model Evaluation:

   * Evaluate your model (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
   * Use a confusion matrix to visualize model performance.

* #### 🛡️ Transfer Learning (Optional):

   * Test pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, Inception).
   * Perform transfer learning and compare results.
   * Helpful links: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning_with_hub), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html)

* #### 💻 Code Quality:

   * Structure your code well, add comments, and document functions clearly.

* #### 📑 Report:

   * Describe your approach: CNN architecture, preprocessing, training details, and results.
   * Highlight your best model and insights from experimentation.

* #### 🛡️ Model Deployment (Bonus!):

   * Deploy the best model using Flask.
   * Allow users to upload images for predictions.
   * +5 Bonus Points if you use TensorFlow Serving!
